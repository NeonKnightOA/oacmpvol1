OACMP Volume 1 Mappools
You can use "oacmp1_enable" and "oacmp1_disable" scripts to enable and disable OACMP Volume 1 maps for "auto change map" feature (g_autonextmap).

To enable: /exec oacmp1_enable
  (this sets g_mappools variable to use OACMP volume 1 pools)
To disable: /exec oacmp1_disable
  (this resets g_mappools variable to OA's default value)
  Important note about "oacmp1_disable" script: it may not work correctly in case you haven't loaded any map yet.
  If needed, just load a map and then exec it again.

The feature works only when you have g_autonextmap set to 1. These scripts do not turn it on or off.

"Auto change map" is a nice feature which allows the game to randomly choose the next map to be played,
picking it from pre-set map lists (mappools) for each gametype.

NOTE: The commands to enable and disable the mappools have been designed around OA 0.8.8 "g_mappools" variable usage. There is the "risk" that future OA versions may rework the feature aiming for a more efficient way (using a configuration file instead of a variable to manage the list of mappool files), breking these commands in the process, but there is nothing decided at the moment of this writing.
