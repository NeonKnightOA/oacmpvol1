== OVERVIEW ==
OpenArena Community Mappack (also called OACMP) is a mappack containing GPL'd maps made by the community itself. The idea is to give GPL servers something else to play aside of the official maps and the already GPLv2'd maps.

== HISTORY ==
This idea started in the official OA forum. Anyone, as long as they respect the rules of the mappack, could be part of the DevTeam for this pack. They don't even need to be mappers, even if they can't produce assets, this doesn't mean that they can't test the maps themselves and give feedback. The style of the map was up to the mappers themselves, with the only important restriction being that everything must be GPLv2'd, like OA itself.

Over the course of more than a year, the OACMP Team worked very hard in this pack. The result is 13 high-quality maps made by 4 mappers and a plethora of contributors.

We hope you enjoy this pack as much as we enjoyed creating it.

== WHY GPLv2? ==
* Maintenance. This means that the entire OACMP team was able to modify/fix the errors in the maps without needing to wait for the authors themselves to appear. It also means that there won't be a need to distribute other parts of the map in a separate package because of differing licenses.
* Compliance with OA's GPL, which means that there aren't any kind of legal problems with using these maps in server rotations.

== TROUBLESHOOTING ==
Before reporting a problem, check if you have additional packages in your game paths. More often than not, most of the common problems have to do with third-party packages (texture compatibility packs or other maps, for example) interfering with the pack or the game's assets. Moving those extra .pk3 files to another place will do the trick.
