*** OpenArena Community Mappack Volume 1 Campaign ***
SINGLE PLAYER MOD

This an extremely simple "mod" which just mixes OACMP Volume 1 maps and standard OA 0.8.8 maps for Single Player Deathmatch "tiers".
Its installation/usage is totally OPTIONAL: you don't need "oacmp1-mod" folder in order to play OACMP maps (while you need OACMP Volume 1 to play the "mod").

To use it, copy "oacmp1-mod" folder to your OpenArena folder (NOT inside "baseoa", but at the same level), then launch the mod from "MODS" menu and select "SINGLEPLAYER".
The "mod" has been designed for OpenArena 0.8.8, and further OA versions may not be completely compatibile with it (while OACMP maps should continue working as usual).
